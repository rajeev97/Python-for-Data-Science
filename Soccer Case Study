Basic Steps in a Data Science Project

1. Data Acquisition
2. Data Preparation
3. Data Analysis
4. Report
5. Actions Based on Analysis

The specifics of each process can be different but the overall steps remain the same. 

Data Obtained From Sources can Be Diverse in nature
1. Databases- both relational and nonrelational
2. Text Files-CSV files and Text Files
3. Live Feeds such as sensors and online platforms like Twitter or weather observations

The soccer data is obtained from websites and ingested into Python, which has well defined methods for 
ingesting data like data bases, APIS.

Data Preparation includes data cleaning such as missing entries and outliers and garbage values. These are substituted with well known
aggregate value. 

We use feature selection to select certain domain attributes to perform clustering of data based on it.
This results in models which are easier to analyze, and involves machine learning algorithms.
We use k-means to perform clustering of data.

From this we generate a graph, from which coaches can interpret the action plan for upcoming drills 
to better prepare the soccer team.
