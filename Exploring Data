Exploring Data is a big setp of the 2 step data preparation activity.

In the first step correlations, general trends and outliers must be identified.
Correlation Graphs-used to explore the dependencies
General Trands show a graph of how data is progressing over time.
Outliers  will help detect errors in data and rare events. 

Summary Statistics provide the numberical values to describe data. 
Include mean, median, mode, standard deviation.
Mean and median are measures of the location of specific values.
Mode is the value that is most used in data set. 

Python offers all these functions.

Visualization techniques provide quick and effective useful way of looking at data such as heat maps.
Histograms show distribution of data. 
Boxplots are another type of plots. 
Line Graphs are used to see the variations overtime.
