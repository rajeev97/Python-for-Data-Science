Data cleaning
Transform Data to make it Suitable for Analysis


Data cleaning is required because of 
1. Inconsistent Values
2. Duplicate records
3. Missing Values
4. Invalid Data
5. Outliers

Solution:
1. Remove Data with missing values
2. Merge Duplicate Records
3. Generate best estimate for invalid values
4. remove outliers




Transformation of Data
1. Scaling - Changing range of values to smaller values
2. Transformation-Transformation can be don to reduce noise and variability. This is called aggregation.
3.Feature Selection- removing redundant or irrelavant features, combining features and creating new ones. 
   If two features are closely correllated then it can be removed. 
   There are algorithms to determine most relavant features:
    1. Dimensionalilty reduction is useful when there are large dimensions. It reduces the dimensions in data and makes analysis simpler.
        Ex: Principle Component Analysis
             Data must be moulded to correct format for analysis
