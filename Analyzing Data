The input data is used to build an analysis m
Input Data->Analysis technique->Model->Model Output

Different Techniques 
1. Classification- Goal is to predict the category of input data of a certain type
   (Sunny, Rainy, Windy, etc)
2. Regression- When we need to predict a nummeric value of something
   (Stock prediction)
3. Clustering- Organizing similar items into groups
   (Classification of the population into old, young, and middle age)]
4. Association Analysis-to come up with a set of rules to capture associations between items or events
    used to determine when they come together
    (Market Basket Analysis to predict customer purchasing behavior)
    
Data can be transformed into a graph and outcomes can be determined by graph analytics. 

Modelling
1. Select Technique
2. Build Model
3. Validate Model

We can use data to construct model and use a little of remaining data to evaluating the model.

Evaluating Results
Classification and Regression Together applied can check each other
Clustering can be evaluated by analyzing main objective solved
Association analysis and Graph Analysis is analyzed by examining the real world situation with the prediction.
