Many Websites also host Web services, which provide programmatic access to their data. Several types are discussed below:
1. REST- REPRESENTATIONAL STATE TRANSFER, and is used for implementing web services with performance 
   scalability and maintainability in mind.
2. WEBSOCKET- services allow real time notifications from websites.

These APIS can be used directly or in an application that needs to access the data, like Python Script.
